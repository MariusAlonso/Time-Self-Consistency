# timesc

This package offers tools to perform NLP-inspired self-consistency for time series forecasting. It applies to any forecasting model.

## Setup

## Usage

Notebook `tirex.ipynb` provides example of usage of quantile based forecasting trajectory sampling, both on synthetic time series datasets and real datasets. Self consistency is then applied to these sampled trajectories.
